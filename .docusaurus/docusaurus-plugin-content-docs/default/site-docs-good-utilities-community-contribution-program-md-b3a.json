  "description": "Although GoSwap is started and run by a team of founders and early conductors, the GoSwap ecosystem is for the majority open source. By offering an allocation to our contribution program, you can help us out and earn $GOOD tokens. You will be able to earn these through looking at the open positions / projects. We often are in need of translators, engineers, brainstorm partners, legislations, new business, moderators and outreachers. Our contribution program will soon be announced and opened, please pay close attention to our official channels.",
