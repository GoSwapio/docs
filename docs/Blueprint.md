Our team at GoSwap.io knows how hard it is to get both technical and non-technical questions answered. Whether you are launching your own token or looking to go crosschain with your project, for everything launched there are tons of technical questions. You like to do it right from the start rather than struggling further down the line. There are a lot of micro processes that are involved. GoSwap would like to help out and make these processes easier, we provide a free service to help those in need out. We have a huge network with trusted partners who are there to help and manage this process for you.

GoSwap will create an easy on-board process with some questions these participants have to answer, from there our on-board process starts. This process will take the user by his hands from A-Z, from the right and audited contracts, perhaps an simple website, what to do with social media, marketing, what and how to communicate with your community and potential investors and more.
