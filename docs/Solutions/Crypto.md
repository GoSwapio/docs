## Chain dApps
To position GoSwap as the future contender in the market of DEX solutions we want to position ourselves with a full package on on and off chain solutions. To help projects and their communities to easily swap and bridge their trading pairs, GoSwap will come with several chain dApps.

### Pair Swap
GoSwap will create its own micro swap dApp that can easily be integrated for mobile apps and websites. Within this widget the user is able to select one or more LP’s that they would like to show in this feature. By integrating this feature, the user is able to set a wallet address to receive xx% of each swap that is made through this micro dApp. That way we encourage our users to make use of our ecosystem and ready-to-use / provided features.

### GoBridge
GoSwap will open up its developed bridge for projects who have created trading pairs on multiple chains. By creating a trading pair on different chains, this project is able to make use of the bridge. This bridge will be able to swap tokens between chains with the different tradingpairs or make use of the locked tokens in the bridge to allow effortless and almost costless fees for the bridger. Similar to the Pair Swap the project can set a wallet address to receive xx% swap fees.

## Onboarding
Our team at GoSwap.io knows how hard it is to get both technical and non-technical questions answered. Whether you are launching your own token or looking to go crosschain with your project, for everything launched there are tons of technical questions. You like to do it right from the start rather than struggling further down the line. There are a lot of micro processes that are involved. GoSwap would like to help out and make these processes easier, we provide a free service to help those in need out. We have a huge network with trusted partners who are there to help and manage this process for you.

GoSwap will create an easy on-board process with some questions these participants have to answer, from there our on-board process starts. This process will take the user by his hands from A-Z, from the right and audited contracts, perhaps an simple website, what to do with social media, marketing, what and how to communicate with your community and potential investors and more.

This process looks as follow:
