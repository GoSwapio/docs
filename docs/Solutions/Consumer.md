# Consumer
To support our ecosystem and user growth GoSwap is looking into several consumer solutions. These solutions are on and offramp solutions, but also possibilities to create market making solutions such as trading toolsets. These tools are exclusively created for GoSwap, to boost our token, project listings and the portfolio from our users / customers.

## On & Offramp Solutions
To further support our ecosystem and customers, GoSwap has set a course to find a partner who will allow us to use FIAT on and offramp solutions. Through this way users can buy tokens with FIAT or sell them when needed. These solutions will be integrated in our swaps and on- offchain dApps.

## Trading & Market Making
Our vision is that everyone should be able to trade and support the ecosystem, even for those who have no knowledge about trading. With the approach of AI and technical proved trading patterns it makes it easier for the non technical and pattern skilled user to trade. Mix these methods with a measured UI and none technical language will make this perfect for the skilled / average and non-knowledge crypto interested users.

We envision an professional and approved program where our users can trade in listed pairs from GoSwap but also invest a budget to support active listed LPs, blockchains, single tokens. So besides the AMM and the active Market Maker partners, GoSwap allows everyone to earn rewards from supporting LPs. GoSwap makes it its goal to build this trading program for both the website and eventually a native mobile application. This program will only support listed tokens and pairs from GoSwap.
