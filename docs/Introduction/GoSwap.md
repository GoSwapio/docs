We hereby present GoSwap a new and unique market trading platform. We build on web3 alone and are determined to be here for the long-term.

GoSwap is a swap focussing on the coinbase base blockchain (L2) and will be launched with a $GOOD | USDB (Base USD) pair, but not limited to. GoSwap does not use a market maker but introduces a unique system where liquidity pools are automatically created and funded by returning a percentage of each swap to the liquidity pool. This principle is also called an AMM, Automated Market Maker.

GoSwap focuses mainly on emerging chains, which means we position ourselves uniquely in the market, which is why we chose to Initiate our journey by going live with BASE.

Built for and by our community, GoSwap introduces a number of unique token utility perks that encourage our community to be connected to GoSwap.
