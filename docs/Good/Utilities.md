## Grants
In the near future GoSwap is looking to open up the grants program. Grants will be used to connect upcoming projects that transform the crypto and tech space. We at GoSwap believe in close partnerships and therefore we would like to reach out and help those amazing projects.

## Contribution Program
Although GoSwap is started and run by a team of founders and early conductors, the GoSwap ecosystem is for the majority open source. By offering an allocation to our contribution program, you can help us out and earn $GOOD tokens. You will be able to earn these through looking at the open positions / projects. We often are in need of translators, engineers, brainstorm partners, legislations, new business, moderators and outreachers. Our contribution program will soon be announced and opened, please pay close attention to our official channels.
