Once 4 years have passed, 2% of the revenue generating supply will be burned each year. The burn distribution will be calculated as follow:

Revenue in tokens / 100 * 2% = Tokens to be burned

Additional burns are planned to reduce supply based on usage and demand from market, as it is hard to predecide on this, GoSwap gouvernance will review Burn plans every 6 months. Any additional burn cannot exceed 1% of supply.
