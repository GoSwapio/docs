# GoSwap Governance Structure

## Introduction

The GoSwap governance structure is designed to ensure the active participation of our community in shaping the future of our decentralized ecosystem. We believe in transparency, fairness, and community-driven decision-making. This document outlines the decision-making process based on proposal types and tokens staked.

## Proposal Types

1. **Development Proposals:** These proposals pertain to changes, upgrades, or enhancements to the GoSwap platform's technical infrastructure.

2. **Security Improvements:** Proposals aimed at enhancing the security and robustness of the GoSwap ecosystem fall under this category.

3. **Token Allocations for Incubated Projects:** Proposals related to the allocation of $GOOD tokens for incubated projects that are part of the GoSwap ecosystem.

4. **Token Allocations for Liquidity Providers (LP):** Proposals regarding the allocation of $GOOD tokens to liquidity providers or LPs on the GoSwap platform.

5. **Cross-Chain Initiatives for $GOOD Token:** Proposals focused on cross-chain initiatives involving the $GOOD token.

## Decision Power

The decision-making process in the GoSwap governance structure is determined by the number of tokens staked and the type of proposal.

1. **Token Holding Duration:** Holders of $GOOD tokens only receive voting powers if they are staking their tokens for a minimum duration of 6 months. This requirement encourages long-term commitment and aligns the interests of token holders with the success of the GoSwap ecosystem.

2. **Token Weightage:** The voting power for each proposal is determined by the number of $GOOD tokens held by the voter. Specifically, the more tokens an individual holds, the greater their voting power.

3. **Decision Threshold:** To accept and execute a proposal, it must receive a majority vote of at least 51% of the $GOOD tokens in circulation. In cases where voters abstain from voting, their votes are disregarded, and their voting power for that specific proposal is voided.

4. **Tied Votes:** If a vote results in a tie, the proposal needs to be re-written and brought into voting again. This iterative process ensures that proposals with significant community support are eventually accepted or rejected based on the consensus of the community.

## Conclusion

The GoSwap governance structure is designed to empower our community to actively participate in decision-making and contribute to the growth and success of the GoSwap ecosystem. We are committed to transparency, fairness, and the long-term sustainability of our decentralized platform, and we believe that this governance model aligns the interests of our stakeholders with the future of GoSwap.
