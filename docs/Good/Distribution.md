**Unlocking the Potential of $GOOD: GoSwap's Tokenomics under Community Governance**

Cryptocurrency projects often revolve around the principles of decentralization and community involvement. The tokenomics of $GOOD, the native token of GoSwap, align perfectly with these values. What sets $GOOD apart is that any token allocation, grant, usage, or distribution is determined by the GoSwap Governance Group. This decentralized decision-making committee consists of $GOOD holders, making the ecosystem truly community-driven. Total supply is 750.000.000 $GOOD.

**Total Supply and Distribution under Community Governance**

With a total supply of 750,000,000 tokens, $GOOD's distribution takes on a community-centric approach, thanks to the GoSwap Governance Group.

- **Community (60%)**: A substantial portion, amounting to 450,000,000 $GOOD, is earmarked for the community. Over a span of four years, 28,125,000 tokens per quarter will be released, all subject to the decisions of the GoSwap Governance Group. This gradual release ensures ongoing community engagement.

- **Ecosystem Dripping (40%)**: To nurture the ecosystem further, 40% of the total supply (300,000,000 $GOOD) is allocated for various purposes, all under the watchful eye of the GoSwap Governance Group. These tokens are divided as follows:

    - **Liquidity Mining (10%)**: Each quarter, 4,687,500 $GOOD will be dedicated to liquidity mining, driven by the decisions of the governance committee.
