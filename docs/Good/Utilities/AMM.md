Each token project LP creator will be able to select several percentages that will be used to deposit back a percentage of each swap that takes place on a liquidity pool. These percentages are as follow:

**0.01%**
Best for very stable pairs

**0.05%**
Best for stable pairs

**0.3%**
Best for most pairs

**1%**
Best for exotic pairs

This is called automated market making. It means that with each swap the LP will grow over time naturally, which means more value for the listed token project.

When creating a pair without native $GOOD token, you will be receiving an additional percentage for each deposit. Please take note of the references in the distribution chapter.
